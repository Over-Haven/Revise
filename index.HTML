    <h1 class="a">My fev car is dodge challenger</h1>
    <p>The Dodge Challenger is the name of three different generations of automobiles produced by the American automobile
    manufacturer Dodge. However, the first use of the Challenger name by Dodge dates back to 1959 for marketing a "value
    version" of the full-sized Coronet Silver Challenger.
</p>
<p>From model years 1970 to 1974, the first-generation Dodge Challenger pony car was built using the Chrysler E platform in
hardtop and convertible body styles sharing significant components with the Plymouth Barracuda.[1]

<h1 class="a">My fev car is GTR r35</h1>
<p>The Nissan GT-R (Gran Turismo–Racing; model code: R35; Japanese: 日産・GT-R; Nissan GT-R) is a car built by Japanese marque
Nissan since 2007. It has a 2+2 seating layout and is considered both a sports car and a grand tourer. The engine is
front-mid mounted and drives all four wheels. It succeeds the Nissan Skyline GT-R, a high-performance variant of the
Nissan Skyline. Although this model was the sixth-generation to bear the GT-R name, it is no longer part of the Skyline
line-up. The car is built on the PM platform, derived from the FM platform used in the Skyline and Nissan Z models.
Production is conducted in a shared production line at Nissan's Tochigi plant in Japan.
</p>
<p>As per Nissan's intention of creating a world beating sports car, the GT-R brand was revived as part of the Nissan
Revival Plan. Overall development began in 2000, following seven years of development and testing, including the
introduction of two concept models in 2001 and 2005. The production version of the GT-R was unveiled at the 2007 Tokyo
Motor Show. The GT-R is a brand-new car built on the PM platform, and featured innovative concepts and technologies,
such as advanced aerodynamics, the VR38DETT engine, an active suspension system and the ATTESA E-TS Pro all-wheel-drive
system, making it the first ever rear mounted independent transaxle all-wheel-drive vehicle. It is one of the first
production cars to feature launch control and a dual-clutch transmission as well. The overall body is made out of steel,
aluminium and carbon-fibre. In 2009 it set a record for the fastest accelerating 4-seater production car.

<p>Sales in the Australian market were ceased due to high demand and new side impact regulations. In the European market,
including the United Kingdom were similarly suspended, due to newly implemented noise regulations. Currently, the car is
primarily available in North America, Japan, and some markets.
